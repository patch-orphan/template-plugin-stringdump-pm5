DESCRIPTION
    This Template::Toolkit plugin adds the "dump" filter, which dumps
    strings of characters or bytes for display and debugging. This filter is
    a simple wrapper around the "dumpstr" function from the String::Dump
    module. The filter takes the "dumpstr" mode as an optional argument,
    defaulting to "hex". See String::Dump for details.

    The filter name "dump" was selected instead of "dumpstr" because filters
    only work on strings, so the name would be repetitive. It also doesn't
    compete with other TT plugins like Template::Plugin::Dump or
    Template::Plugin::Dumper because they need to function on data
    structures, as opposed to strings, so they don't provide filters.
